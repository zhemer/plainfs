Source code revision.

FS structure is changed, mkfs is added.

Filesystem structure

Filesystem has no superblock and directories. File names and inodes are stored in single place in structure dinode.
Filesystem has one file table stored in first logical block of partition.
Therefore number of files is limited to BLK_SIZE/sizeof(struct dinode), that equals to 25 files (if dinode size is 20 bytes).
After the files table data goes.

block | content
---------------
0     | file table
1     | first file's data
2     | second file's data
...   | ...
n     | last file's data
n+1   | rest of partition - unused
