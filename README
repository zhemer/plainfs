Filesystem structure

Filesystem has no superblock and directories. File names and inodes are stored
in single place in structure dinode. You can see structure in source code.
Filesystem has one file table stored in first logical block of partition.
Therefore number of files is limited to BLK_SIZE/sizeof(struct dinode).
That equals to 25 files (if dinode size is 20 bytes).
After the table files' data goes.

block | content
---------------
0     | file table
1     | first file's data
2     | second file's data
...   | ...
n     | last file's data
n+1   | rest of partition - unused

As you can see the filesystem structure is very simple.
